Hi I am Karthika Krishna

.git folder is created as a default folder when we clone git repository.It is created even when we clone an empty repository. 
We should not delete it as it acts a direct link between our local machine repository and cloud repository in git hub

U -> untracked

git add -> working directory to staging area
(It is like keeping a letter inside envelope)

git commit -> staging area to repository
(It is like writing aclear message about the letter on top of the letter to let others know what we are doing)

git push -> posting the staged letter(code) to the repository

Commit hash -> An unique number that is generated from the Date, Time, From address, To Address we written on the envelope

git reset -> To unstage the staged files
