Hi I am Karthika Krishna M

.git folder is created as a default folder when we clone git repository.It is created even when we clone an empty repository. 
We should not delete it as it acts a direct link between our local machine repository and cloud repository in git hub

U -> untracked

git add -> working directory to staging area
(It is like keeping a letter inside envelope)

git commit -> staging area to repository
(It is like writing aclear message about the letter on top of the letter to let others know what we are doing)

git push -> posting the staged letter(code) to the repository

Commit hash -> An unique number that is generated from the Date, Time, From address, To Address we written on the envelope

git reset -> To unstage the staged files

!Fix: Breakthrough change

After staging the untracked becomes tracked

git push origin remote

Origin -> Initial cloned url
remote -> The branch in which we are trying to push our code which can be main or any other sub branches assigned to us

git status -> It shows the tracked and untracked files

We are trying to add index.html but not style.css

When we git status after git add it will show the next step of commiting that file

git status -> which file got modified

git diff -> what exactly got modified in that file

M -> modified

U -> untracked or unmodified

git add . -> Add all files in the current folder

git branch -> to check at which branch we are present

git checkout -b "frontend" -> for new branch

git checkout main -> to move to main branch

git checkout frontend -> to move to frontend
